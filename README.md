## Lyfjabox
During coding we used IntelliJ Ultimate IDE environment with Maven.

## How do I run this ?
This project is setup using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) as a dependency manager, so if your IDE
does not manage that, or you don't have it installed you can look [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) for
further information.
When all the dependencies are downloaded, you can run the project by running the ``main()`` method in the class
``Application`` and then enter [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) into the address bar of your favorite web browser.

### Database
Database is online and is automatically connected to application when it is running.
Drug table in database currently has the following drugs do search for:
"Panodil"
"Parkodin"
"Benylan"
"Canesten"
"Daktakort"
"Ibufen"
"Kalmente"
"Kestine"
"Voltaren"
"Zovir"
